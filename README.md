## Usage
#### Including
Clone the project, and import the module in your app. ThetaLiveVR use [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), so you can use which method suits the better for your project.


#### Creating a ThetaLiveVR instance
You'll need a container which will render the view, a canvas to act as a texture and an URI to your motion-jpeg stream. How easy.
```js
let container = document.getElementById('container');
let canvas    = document.getElementById('canvas');
let streamURI = 'http://localhost:8080/stream.jpg';

let liveVR    = new ThetaLiveVR(container, canvas, 'test.jpg');
liveVR.init();
```
